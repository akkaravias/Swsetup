TITLE:  HP vs Series LCD Monitor Drivers

VERSION: 2.00 Rev. A
DESCRIPTION:
This package contains the HP Display Installer program, which automatically detects the Microsoft Operating System that is running on your computer and installs the corresponding .INF and .ICM driver files that are used to configure the listed HP monitors.

For the Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition, and Microsoft Windows XP Professional (32-bit and 64-bit) Operating Systems, Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) certified monitor drivers are installed. For the Microsoft Windows 98 and Microsoft Windows Millennium (ME) Edition Operating Systems, non-WHQL drivers are installed.

The setup information, or .INF file, defines monitor resources used by Microsoft Windows in order to ensure monitor compatibility with the graphics card installed in your computer.

The image color matching, or .ICM file, is a color data file that is used in conjunction with graphics applications to provide consistent color matching from monitor screen to printer, or from scanner to the monitor screen. The .ICM file is only activated from within the graphics applications that support this feature.

MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT 4.0 INF AND ICM INSTALLATION NOTES:
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 does not currently use monitor INF files.
Display Resolutions in Windows NT are controlled by the computer's graphics adapter.  
There is no Monitor selection unless the graphics adapter includes this
option with its own proprietary video drivers (which do not ship with Windows NT).
The ICM color profile file can be used within Windows NT and is activated
from within the graphics programs that have this feature.


PLUG AND PLAY COMPATIBILITY: 
HP monitors are Microsoft Windows Plug and Play compatible.
HP monitors will work correctly without their INF and ICM files installed. 
With the monitor attached directly to your computer, and without the INF file installed, 
Microsoft Windows 98, ME, 2000 and XP will recognize your HP monitor as a 
"Plug and Play Monitor."  
The correct resolutions will be available in the Windows Display control panel.
Note that monitor Plug and Play compatibility is dependent on several items:
    a) The computer's graphics card must be VESA DDC2 compliant.
    b) The graphics card driver must be installed and the card recognized by Microsoft Windows.
    c) The monitor must be connected directly to the graphics card.
        Plug and Play does not work through the separate BNC type 
        connectors nor through distribution buffers or boxes.
